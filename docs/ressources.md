      | SINDy* | Linear SR | [URL]() | 2016 | Formulates the SR problem as a system of linear equations and learns the coefficients of candidate functions |
      | SINDy_AE | DL (AE) | [URL](https://github.com/kpchamp/SindyAutoencoders) | 2019 | Consists of a deep  autoencoder (AE) network to discover coordinates and governing equations of dynamical systems |
      | EQL* | DL (NN) | [URL]() | 2016 | Consists of an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward neural network whose activation functions are algebraic operators and analytical functions instead of traditional activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, relu, softmax).|
      | EQL$\div$ | DL (NN) | [URL](https://github.com/martius-lab/EQL) | 2018 | This is an extendable version of EQL that includes the division operator.|
      | Eureqa | GP | [URL]() | xx | It is a closed-source code that uses genetic programming |
      | PySR | GP | [URL](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR) | 2023 | |

      | DSR | RL | [URL]() | xx | |
      | NeSymReS | DL (TNN) | [URL]() | xx | A pre-trained transformer that predicts SR models directly from the data. Predicted models are then fine-tuned and the best is returned.|
