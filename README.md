# A living Review of Symbolic Regression

This review is made in analogy with the review of machine learning for particle physics [here](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/).

The purpose of this note is to collect references for symbolic regression. Notes will be later reference as per category to be as easy and sueful as possible. 
A minimal number of categories is chosen in order to be as useful as possible.
