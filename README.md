# A living Review of Symbolic Regression

This review is made in analogy with "A Living Review of Machine Learning for Particle Physics" that can be found [here](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/).

Symbolic regression aims to learn the underlying model in a given dataset, by searching the space of mathematical functions the analytical equation that best fit data. A growing interest in symbolic regression is taking place in the AI community because it balances between model complexity and interpretability. 

The goal of this repository is to collect references for symbolic regression. Notes will be later categorized in an as easy and useful manner as possible.
